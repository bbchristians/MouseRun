# MouseRun
A game I made the summer after my first year of college. The purpose of the game is to teach basic programming principles to young children.

## To run the game
Download the contents of this repository, then run (Test1.exe)[MovementTest/Test1.exe]. I recommend starting the game in windowed
mode because I haven't added an option to close the game to the interface.
